	<p class="mt-4 text-xl leading-relaxed">
		Inspired by the language-learning platform <a
			class="anchor"
			href="https://www.duolingo.com">Duolingo</a
		>, Kreolingo is a user-friendly web app designed to help people learn Mauritian Creole.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-4 text-xl leading-relaxed">
		Kreolingo was born out of love and a desire to connect. I wanted to help my partner learn my
		mother tongue. I believe that learning each other's languages can create a profound bond, and I
		want to make that possible for everyone.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-4 text-xl leading-relaxed">
		Whether you are a fellow Mauritian or a curious learner from afar, I invite you to <a

	<h3 class="h3 mt-8">About the language used</h3>
	<p class="mt-4 text-xl leading-relaxed">This app uses Mauritian Creole as I use it. While there are now standardized spellings (like in official dictionaries or classes), I've written things the way they feel most natural to me. Kreol is a living language — and this is one way of speaking it.</p>
